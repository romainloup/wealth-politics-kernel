# Spatial Divides of Wealth Inequality and Politics in Switzerland
_A Kernel and Optimal Transport Approach_

This repository reproduces the results of the paper:
**"Spatial Divides of Wealth Inequality and Politics in Switzerland: A Kernel and Optimal Transport Approach".**

We reconstruct municipal income distributions from Swiss federal tax classes,
build economic/political/linguistic/spatial kernels, compare them at the
**kernel level** (RV, z-scores) and at the **factor level** (correlations between first MDS axes),
and evaluate explanatory power via weighted regressions and residual maps.
